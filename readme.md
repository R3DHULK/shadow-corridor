## Welcome to the Darkness

**Shadow Corridor** is a first-person survival horror experience that challenges you to navigate through an ever-shifting labyrinth while sinister shadow entities hunt you down. With nothing but a faltering flashlight and your wits, can you collect the artifacts needed to escape this nightmare?

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Atmospheric Horror**: Navigate through procedurally generated mazes shrouded in darkness
- **Sanity System**: Stay too long in the dark, and your mind begins to play tricks on you
- **Strategic Resource Management**: Use your flashlight wisely - it's your only defense against the shadows
- **Collectible Artifacts**: Find the key, medkit, and battery to escape the corridor
- **Terrifying Enemies**: Shadow entities with glowing red eyes stalk the hallways, hunting you relentlessly

## 🕹️ Controls

- **WASD**: Move through the corridor
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **F**: Toggle flashlight on/off
- **E**: Interact with objects and items
- **Shift**: Run (use sparingly, as running attracts unwanted attention)

## 💡 Survival Tips

1. **Watch Your Sanity**: Stay in the light to maintain your sanity - hallucinations in the dark can be fatal
2. **Listen Carefully**: Audio cues will alert you to nearby dangers
3. **Conserve Energy**: Running consumes stamina and attracts enemies - use it only when necessary
4. **Find All Artifacts**: You need all three artifacts (key, medkit, battery) to escape
5. **Be Strategic**: Sometimes hiding is better than confronting what lurks in the shadows

## 🔋 Game Mechanics

### Health System
Your health is represented by the red bar at the bottom left. Encounters with shadows will decrease your health. Find medkits to restore it.

### Sanity System
The purple bar represents your sanity. Stay in darkness too long, and it will decrease, causing hallucinations and distorted vision. Keep your flashlight on to maintain sanity.

### Inventory
Collected items appear in the bottom right of your screen. You must find all three artifacts to escape:
- 🔑 **Key**: Essential for unlocking the exit
- 🩹 **Medkit**: Restores your health
- 🔋 **Battery**: Enhances your flashlight's power

## 🚪 Escape the Corridor

Find the red exit marker on the floor once you've collected all artifacts. Interact with it to escape... if you can make it there alive.
